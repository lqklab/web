  abstract = {Multi-axis robotic Force/Moment (F/M) sensors are capable of simultaneously detecting multiple components of force (Fx, Fy, and Fz), as well as the moments (Mx, My and Mz). This enables them to be frequently used in many robotic applications. Accurate, time-effective calibration and decoupling procedures are critical to the implementation of these sensors. This paper compares the effectiveness of decoupling methods based on Least-Squares (LS), BP Neural Network (BPNN), and Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) methods for improving the performance of multi-axis robotic F/M sensors. In order to demonstrate the effectiveness of the decoupling methods, a calibration and decoupling experiment was performed on a five-axis robotic F/M sensor. The experiments demonstrate that the ELM based decoupling method is superior to LS and BPNN based methods. The presented theoretical and experimental demonstrations provide a comprehensive description of the calibration and decoupling procedures of multi-axis robotic F/M sensors. This work reveals that the ELM method is an appropriate and high performing decoupling procedure for multi-axis robotic F/M sensors.},

  title={Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?},
  author={Einstein*†, A. and Podolsky*, B. and Rosen*, N.},
  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
